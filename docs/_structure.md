üìñ CodeCAD Documentation Structure

1. Introduction
   ‚Ä¢ What is CodeCAD?
   ‚Ä¢ Why code-based CAD?
   ‚Ä¢ Key benefits: parametric design, adaptability, reproducibility.
   ‚Ä¢ Comparison to GUI-based CAD tools.

2. Getting Started
   ‚Ä¢ Installation (CLI, viewer, lab).
   ‚Ä¢ First run: generating a simple model.
   ‚Ä¢ Basic workflow: write Lua ‚Üí preview ‚Üí export.

3. Design Principles
   ‚Ä¢ From idea to part: Observe ‚Üí Think ‚Üí Sketch ‚Üí Measure ‚Üí Code.
   ‚Ä¢ Parametric modeling mindset.
   ‚Ä¢ When to sketch on paper vs. when to go straight into CodeCAD.
   ‚Ä¢ Iteration and adaptability (change a parameter ‚Üí regenerate).

4. CodeCAD in Practice
   ‚Ä¢ CodeCAD project structure (explain the project.json file) can have material, parts, meta ...
   ‚Ä¢ From idea to physical part: this should contain a real world example of two parts with different material
   ‚Ä¢ View with live viewer (link to viewer section)
   ‚Ä¢ Export to 3D printing (STL) with `ccad build`
   ‚Ä¢ Export to construction/manufacturing (STEP). `save_step`
   ‚Ä¢ Keeping designs adaptable and reusable.

5. Core Functionality

Grouped by functional ‚Äúpackages,‚Äù with examples for each function:
‚Ä¢ Primitives (box, cylinder, sphere, ‚Ä¶)
‚Ä¢ Curves & Sketch (poly_xy, rect, profile_xz, ‚Ä¶)
‚Ä¢ Transforms (translate, rotate_x, scale, ‚Ä¶)
‚Ä¢ Booleans / Operations (union, difference, intersection)
‚Ä¢ Features (fillet_all, chamfer_all, threaded_rod, ‚Ä¶)
‚Ä¢ Mechanical helpers (pipe_adapter, wedge, ‚Ä¶)
‚Ä¢ Measure & Utilities (bbox, dimensions, tolerances)
‚Ä¢ IO / Workflow (emit, save_stl, save_step)
‚Ä¢ Selection & Advanced usage

üëâ Each function should include: short explanation + Lua example + small rendering screenshot.

6. Architecture
   ‚Ä¢ Kernel (OpenCascade foundations).
   ‚Ä¢ Lua layer (scripting and API).
   ‚Ä¢ CodeCAD CLI (ccad) ‚Äì generating and exporting models.
   ‚Ä¢ CodeCAD Lab ‚Äì interactive environment.

7. Viewer
   ‚Ä¢ Interface overview.
   ‚Ä¢ Shortcuts & navigation.
   ‚Ä¢ Features (layer visibility, measurement tools, section cuts, etc.).
   ‚Ä¢ Export and integration into workflows.

8. Tutorials & Examples
   ‚Ä¢ Beginner: making a parametric box with a hole.
   ‚Ä¢ Intermediate: designing a gear with threaded_rod and Boolean cuts.
   ‚Ä¢ Advanced: assembly of multiple parametric parts.
   ‚Ä¢ Real-world workflows:
   ‚Ä¢ 3D-printable brackets.
   ‚Ä¢ Furniture joints.
   ‚Ä¢ Mechanical adapters.

9. API Reference
   ‚Ä¢ Full Lua API, grouped by package.
   ‚Ä¢ Function signatures, arguments, and defaults.
   ‚Ä¢ Links to example snippets.

10. CodeCAD Library
    ‚Ä¢ The additional library

11. Cheatsheet
    ‚Ä¢ One-page overview of primitives, transforms, operations.
    ‚Ä¢ Exportable as PDF for quick desk reference.

12. Glossary (optional but useful)
    ‚Ä¢ Engineering & CAD terminology (your German-English table fits here).
    ‚Ä¢ Quick definitions for newcomers.
