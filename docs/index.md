# CodeCAD - Parametric CAD with Lua

CodeCAD is a modern, code-driven CAD system designed for makers, engineers, and researchers who want **simplicity, power, and reproducibility** in 3D modeling.

Instead of clicking through menus, you describe your parts in **clean Lua code**. Your models live in plain text, are easy to version with Git, and can be previewed instantly in the built-in viewer.

## Why CodeCAD?

- ✨ **Simplicity first** – Minimal API, easy to learn. You can start with a box in just one line of code.
- ⚡ **Frictionless workflow** – Edit your Lua script → see the 3D model update live.
- 🛠️ **Robust kernel** – Built on [OpenCascade (OCCT)](https://www.opencascade.com/), a proven industrial-grade geometry library.
- 💾 **Reproducible** – Everything is text-based. Store, version, and review your designs with Git.
- 🎯 **Developer-friendly** – Feels natural if you’re a programmer. Model complex parts like writing software.
- 📝 **neovim** – Best experience with neovim as your primary editor.

## Why Lua?

- 🐚 Small, clean, embeddable scripting language.
- 📦 No dependencies, works everywhere.
- 🧩 Perfect for building a concise, domain-specific modeling language.

With Lua, you describe parts with code that is **easy to read, easy to share, and easy to maintain**.

## Who is CodeCAD for?

- 🧑‍🔧 **Makers** – Design printable parts and assemblies faster.
- 🏭 **Engineers** – Prototype mechanisms, gears, bolts, and housings parametrically.
- 🔬 **Researchers** – Explore geometry and manufacturing processes in a programmable, reproducible way.
- 🔬 **Software developers** – Transform your way of working into modeling.

💡 With CodeCAD, you’re not just designing parts – you’re **writing the blueprint of your ideas**.
