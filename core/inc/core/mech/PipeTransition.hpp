/**
 * @file PipeTransition.hpp
 * @brief Build a smooth revolved transition between two pipes using analytic blends (tanh / logistic / smoothstep).
 *
 * The transition is modeled as a solid of revolution around the Z axis. We sample the inner and outer radii
 * as functions of z in [0, length], build a closed XZ-profile (outer curve up, inner curve back),
 * and revolve it (0..2Ï€) to obtain a watertight solid.
 *
 * Coordinate system:
 *   - Z is the pipe axis (0 .. length)
 *   - The profile is constructed in the XZ plane (y = 0), with X = radius(z), Z = axial position
