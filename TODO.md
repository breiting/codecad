# TODOs

- [ ] Docker container for Kernel and Service
- [ ] Work on Gears module

## Further ideas

### General

- Integrate triangulation parameters in ImGui
- Make tutorials
- Animations for parts
- `build` should be available from within the viewer (shortcut `b`)
- Let the viewer camera be controlled by Lua code (trajectories)
- Make CodeCAD as backend-service which does the heavy lifting and returns geometry
- Simple web-based viewer using CodeCAD as backend

### Lua Library Ideas

- Langloch
- Senkkopfschraube
