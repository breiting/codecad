# TODO

- [ ] Project params should be populated to all parts (e.g. size of a table should be defined in project and populated to all parts)
- [ ] Lua snippets for CodeCAD
- [ ] Fix gears module
- [ ] Camera should always use the bounding box as rotation center
- [ ] Show/hide ininity grid with a keyboard shortcut in viewer
- [ ] Implement threads
- [ ] Select specific edges for chamfer and fillet
- [x] Optimize `ccad parts add --name "<name>"` to `ccad add` (name is optional)
- [x] Implement BOM collector in C++

## Further ideas

- Start Patreon
- Animations for parts
- Project parameters should be shown in viewer and should be modifiable
- `build` should be available from within the viewer (shortcut `b`)
- Let the viewer camera be controlled by Lua code (trajectories)
- Import STEP and/or DXF?
- Support for textures in viewer
