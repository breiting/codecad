# TODOs

- [ ] Docker container for Kernel and Service
- [ ] Work on Gears module

## Further ideas

### General

- Nicer error prints on console, if lua does not get compiled
- Integrate triangulation parameters in ImGui
- Make tutorials
- Animations for parts
- Let the viewer camera be controlled by Lua code (trajectories)
- Make CodeCAD as backend-service which does the heavy lifting and returns geometry

### Lua Library Ideas

- Slot (Langloch)
- Skrew hole with chamfer
