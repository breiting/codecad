# TODOs

- [ ] Docker container
- [ ] Work on Gears module
- [ ] Select specific edges for chamfer and fillet

## Further ideas

- Make tutorials
- Animations for parts
- `build` should be available from within the viewer (shortcut `b`)
- Let the viewer camera be controlled by Lua code (trajectories)
- Make CodeCAD as backend-service which does the heavy lifting and returns geometry
- Simple web-based viewer using CodeCAD as backend
