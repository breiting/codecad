# CodeCAD Lua Library Collection

> IMPORTANT! The examples and samples folders are outdated and will not work anymore. They will be reworked as CCAD project soon!

This directory contains a useful set of Lua functions on top of the CodeCAD Core functionality.

## Installation

The library should get installed automatically. If not, you can easily manually install the files.
Just copy over the content of the lib and types folder to your installed CodeCAD path. For instance, if you have
installed CodeCAD under $HOME/codecad, you just have to do this:

```bash
cp -r lib/* $HOME/codecad/share/codecad/lib
cp -r types/* $HOME/codecad/share/codecad/types
```

Done. You should now be ready to use the library from within CodeCAD.

Have fun!
